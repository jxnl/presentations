# Email 8: What Now? (The Real Next Step)

**Subject:** You've got the system. Here's how to get your team on board.

---

You've made it through all 8 emails. You have:
- ✅ An AI champion identified (or you became one)
- ✅ Planning skills that prevent wasted work
- ✅ AGENTS.md preventing obvious mistakes
- ✅ Custom commands automating your PR workflow
- ✅ CLI tools AI uses to test itself
- ✅ MCP servers eliminating context switching
- ✅ Background agents working while you sleep

**Here's what I know about you:** You're not the person who just reads about AI. You're the person who actually implements it.

## The Problem With Going Solo

Here's what happens when you try to roll this out to your team alone:

**Week 1:** You show them your new workflow. They're skeptical.
**Week 2:** You try to explain AGENTS.md. They nod politely.
**Week 3:** You demonstrate custom commands. They say "that's cool" and go back to their old way.
**Week 4:** You're the only one using AI. Everyone else is waiting to see if it "actually works."

**Sound familiar?** This is why 80% of AI implementations fail when done solo.

## The Team Problem (And How We Solve It)

**The real challenge isn't learning AI tools. It's getting your team to trust them.**

**What email can't give you:**
- **Team buy-in sessions** where everyone sees the workflow work on your actual codebase
- **Live troubleshooting** when someone says "this won't work with our legacy system"
- **Peer learning** where your engineers see other teams' real implementations
- **Standardization templates** you can copy-paste into your repo
- **Change management strategies** that actually work with skeptical engineers

## The 3-Day Team Transformation

**Day 1:** Bring your team. We build features using your exact codebase. No toy examples.
**Day 2:** Your engineers pair with teams who've already done this. They see it work.
**Day 3:** Hackathon where your team implements these tools on your actual project.

**You also get:**
- **Team licenses** so everyone can try the tools
- **Custom onboarding** for your specific tech stack
- **Team templates** for AGENTS.md, commands, and workflows
- **Private Slack** where your team gets ongoing support

## Real Team Results

> "I brought my 3-person team. By day 3, they were arguing over who got to demo their AI-built feature. We went from 'AI is scary' to 'this is how we work now' in 72 hours." - Sarah, Engineering Manager

> "The email series got me started. The cohort got my whole team on board. We shipped 3 features in the first week back that would have taken a month." - Mike, Senior Engineer

> "My team was resistant until they saw other teams doing it live. The cohort gave us the social proof we needed. Now we're the team other teams ask for advice." - Lisa, Staff Engineer

## The Team Math

**Solo implementation:** 3-6 months of convincing, maybe 50% adoption
**Cohort approach:** 3 days, 100% team buy-in, immediate results

**Cost:** Less than one week of your team's combined salary
**ROI:** Teams typically see 2-3x productivity within 30 days

## Built for Teams (Not Individuals)

**We cap it at 50 people total, but teams get priority:**
- **Team discounts** for 3+ people from the same company
- **Custom breakout sessions** for your specific tech stack
- **Team-specific templates** you can deploy immediately
- **Ongoing team support** in our private Slack

**P.S.** If you're thinking "my team isn't ready," remember: every team thinks that. The ones who move first get the competitive advantage.

**P.P.S.** Still not sure? Reply with your team's tech stack. I'll show you exactly how teams like yours have implemented this successfully.
