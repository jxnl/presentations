# Cloud Agent Presentation - Deck-Specific Notes

## Deck Overview

This deck covers the Cloud Cursor Agent CLI tool - a command-line interface for launching AI agents that work on GitHub repositories.

## Content Approach

- **Content-first drafting** - Focus on structure and information, no animations yet
- **Simple layouts** - Using two-cols and center layouts as needed
- **Speaker notes** - Added throughout for presenter guidance
- **QRCode component** - Used only at the end for resources (following drafting phase rules)

## Personalization Choices

- **Author/Twitter**: Uses @jxnlco (standard across decks)
- **Theme**: Default Slidev theme
- **Layout**: Mix of single-column, two-column, and center layouts based on content needs
- **Components**: Only QRCode used (drafting phase restriction)

## Structure

The presentation follows this flow:

1. Title slide
2. Introduction (what it is, problem it solves)
3. Installation & Setup
4. Core Concepts (Agents, Plans, Models)
5. Launching Agents (commands and options)
6. Managing Agents (watch, list, status, followup, etc.)
7. Critical Rule (parallelization)
8. Use Cases (bug fixes, refactoring, features, parallel work)
9. Adding to Your Project
10. Technical Details (optional architecture overview)
11. Summary
12. Resources with QR code

- Documentation referenced in the presentation
- CLI commands and options based on actual tool functionality

## Notes for Future Polish

When moving to polishing phase:

- Consider adding Terminal component for command examples
- Add Callout components for important warnings (especially parallelization rule)
- Consider animations for:
  - Command examples appearing step-by-step
  - Use case workflows
  - Parallelization examples
- FileExplorer component could show plan file structure
- Chart component could visualize parallelization scenarios

## Content Sources

- Based on the cloud-cursor-agent CLI tool documentation
- Plan structure follows the format described in AGENTS.md workspace rules
- Commands and options match the actual CLI tool interface
