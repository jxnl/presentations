# Email 1: The AI Champion Strategy

**Subject:** Your company's AI coding future (2-minute read)

**By the end of this email, you'll be able to:**

- Identify the right AI champion for your engineering team
- Start your first step toward AI-powered development

Hi there,

You're getting this email because you're either:

**A) The leader** who's been asked to "figure out AI coding" for your engineering team, or
**B) The person** who's been handed this problem and told "make it happen"

Either way, you're in the right place. Over this series, you'll also see why **team standards matter as much as tools**—that's how leaders avoid chaos and ICs avoid rework.

> **For team leads:** Your job is to identify and empower an AI champion who can drive adoption across your team.
>
> **For IC implementers:** You're about to become the most valuable engineer at your company by building systems that make everyone 2-3x more productive.

## Who's Teaching You This

**Jason Liu:** I advise startups and consult on AI systems. I've focused on helping companies build experimentation systems, retrieval systems, and research tools with AI. I work closely with both OpenAI and Anthropic on how they think about AI-assisted code.

**Vignesh Mohankumar:** Early engineer at Drift ($1.2B acquisition) and Kensho ($550M acquisition). Now founder of Nila. He writes 100% of his code using Cursor with zero tab completions—he's living the system we'll teach you.

**Why this matters:** This isn't theory. We've already trained 200+ engineers in live cohorts with speakers from Cursor, OpenAI, Cognition, Sourcegraph, and Linear. Every recommendation here comes from battle-tested experience across real companies. Want to join the next cohort? [Learn more →](https://maven.com/nila/ai-coding-accelerator?promoCode=EMAIL)

## If You're the Leader

Your job isn't to learn every AI coding tool. Your job is to **identify your AI Champion** - that one engineer who will own this transformation.

**Look for someone who:**

- Has 5+ years experience (they understand your codebase)
- Actually enjoys trying new tools (not just talks about them)
- Has some management/mentoring experience (they know how to teach)
- Can dedicate 20% of their time for the next 3 months

**Your action item:** Reply to this email with "I'm the leader" and I'll send you a 5-question assessment to help identify your champion.

## If You're the Implementer

You're probably thinking "great, another thing on my plate." But here's the thing - you're about to become the most valuable engineer at your company.

**This isn't about learning 47 new tools.** It's about building one system that makes your entire team 2-3x more productive.

**Your action item:** Reply with "I'm the implementer" and I'll send you this week's first step - a 15-minute setup that immediately shows value to your team.

## Your 7-Email Roadmap to AI-Powered Development

Over the next 7 emails, you'll get one email per week with a specific skill that builds on the last. Here's exactly what you'll learn:

**Email 1: Planning Mastery** - The 80% of AI success that happens before you write code. You'll learn how to load context effectively and create collaborative plans that prevent wasted work.

**Email 2: The 15-Minute Setup** - Create an AGENTS.md file that prevents recurring AI mistakes, plus infrastructure that catches errors before they reach production.

**Email 3: Custom Commands** - Turn your repeated AI instructions into reusable slash commands that automate PR workflows and save 20-30 minutes per pull request.

**Email 4: Agent Toolkit** - Build simple CLI tools that AI agents can use to test their own work, creating utilities you'd never prioritize but that multiply productivity.

**Email 5: MCP Servers** - Connect AI agents to external tools like Linear or JIRA, eliminating context switching and letting you create tickets without leaving your editor.

**Email 6: Asynchronous Agents** - Scale from supervised 200-line PRs to autonomous background tasks, delegating work that would never get done because it's "not worth the context switch."

**Email 7: Integration & Scale** - Set up custom Slack integrations so your team can mention AI agents like human colleagues, creating a true AI-powered development workflow.

Each email takes 15-30 minutes to implement and includes real examples from companies already doing this successfully.

No fluff. No "AI will change everything" hype. Just practical steps that work.

**Next email:** Planning mastery - the 80% of AI coding that happens before you write a single line of code.

Hit reply and let me know which one you are.

Best,
Jason

P.S. - If you're both the leader and the implementer, reply with "both" and I'll send you both paths. Also, email readers get 30% off our live 3-day cohort with live coding, guest speakers from Cursor, OpenAI, and more, plus a hackathon.
