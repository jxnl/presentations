# Your Company Has an AI Mandate: Here's the Playbook Your Team Can Actually Run

**Subject:** The 8-email plan that turns "figure out AI" into actual results

---

## Someone Said "We Need to Use AI More" — Now What?

You have two choices:

- **Choice A:** 6 months of trial and error, frustrated engineers, explaining to leadership why nothing's faster
- **Choice B:** 8 emails, 30 minutes each, proven system that makes teams 2-3x more productive

## Built for Leaders, Useful for ICs

**If you're the leader:** Your job is to identify your AI champion - that one engineer who'll drive this transformation. I'll send you a 5-question assessment to find them. Leaders: forward this series to your team; each email is implementable in 30 minutes.

**If you're the implementer:** You're about to become the most valuable engineer at your company. I'll send you the first step - a 15-minute setup that immediately shows value.

## Who's Running This

**Jason Liu:** Advisor and consultant specializing in AI systems for startups. I've built experimentation systems, retrieval pipelines, and research workflows with AI at scale.

**Vignesh Mohankumar:** Early engineer at Drift (acquired $1.2B) and Kensho (acquired $550M). Now founder of Nila. He writes 100% of production code using Cursor with zero tab completions—this is his actual workflow.

This isn't theoretical. Vignesh has shipped this system across multiple companies. Every recommendation here comes from real production experience, not blog posts. We've trained 200+ engineers in live cohorts. [Join the next cohort →](https://maven.com/nila/ai-coding-accelerator?promoCode=EMAIL)
